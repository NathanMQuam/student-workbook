**4.** Given this array: 
```js
let fruit = ['apple', 'banana', 'pineapple',  'orange', 'strawberry']
``` 
What index is the pineapple's current position? How do you know?
<!-- enter your answer in the space below -->
```
  [2], because arrays are index 0 based, 'apple' is 0, 'banana' is 1, and 'pineapple' is 2
```
**5.** With these two objects: 
```js
let you = { name:"You", hair: true, friends: [] }
let them = { name:"Them", hair: false, friends: [] }
```
how would you .push the `them` object into the `you` object's array of friends?
<!-- enter your answer in the space below -->
```
  you.friends.push(them)
```

**6.** Give an example of a JavaScript `Conditional`:
<!-- enter your answer in the space below -->
```
  (num1 >= num2) || (str1 == "comparison string")
```
**7.** In the `for loop` below, what is the name of the piece belongs inside the empty "______" space? What would you put here to increase `i` by one on every iteration?
```js
for ( let i = 0; i < arr.length; _______ ) {
  //...
```
<!-- enter your answer in the space below -->
```
This is the 'Increment Expression,' which is a line of code that is always run after every time the below block of code is run. It is usually used to increment or decrement the 'i' variable.
