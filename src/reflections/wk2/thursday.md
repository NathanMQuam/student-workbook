Read Intro to JS > The Mistakes I Made As a Beginner Programmer and answer the following questions
1. What are the benefits of making a plan before starting to just write the code?
`For smaller afternoon projects, a plan isn't always necessary, but the more complex a project is the more a plan will be needed to keep track of everything. A plan can help you go over future problems, lay out the foundation of the project, and break the project down into smaller manageable chunks. A plan is also almost required if there's more than one person working on the project.`

2. How do you find answers when you are stuck?
`One way to find answers when you are stuck is to go online and see if anyone else has had the same issue as you, or if the documentation has anything helpful. If you are stuck for very long you should ask for help from others, like other students, co-workers, supervisors or instructors, because they can provide invaluable insight, especially if they already know how to solve the issue that has you stuck.`

3. From the entire article what are your biggest takeaways?
`* "Always code as if the guy who ends up maintaining your code will be a violent psychopath who knows where you live.

* "You should just assume that any undocumented code that you do not understand is a candidate for being bad. Question it. Ask about it. `git blame` it!
* "You are a forever code learner. You need to accept that. Most code reviews will teach you something you did not know. Categorize them as a learning resource."
* "You are a human and your brain needs breaks. Your body needs breaks. You will often be in the zone and forget to take breaks. - Come back to the code with fresh eyes."`
