## Daily Journal

Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > Understanding Component Based Architecture and answer the following questions

1. What is Component based architecture?
`
CBA is "a method for encapsulating individual pieces of a larger user interface (aka components) into self-sustaining, independent micro-systems." In other words, it is a collection of many small reusable systems, or components, that are all modular and completely independent from one another.
`

2. What are some benefits of Component based architecture?
`
CBA makes interfaces and the architecture of an application more modular and individually encapsulates components, making it easier to create and use. It also allows each component to update without requiring the entire page to refresh.
`

3. What are some drawbacks to Component based architecture?
`
With CBA, the interface can easily become bloated and polluted. Many developers end up treating CBA more like a framework and over engineer every aspect of the application as a component.
