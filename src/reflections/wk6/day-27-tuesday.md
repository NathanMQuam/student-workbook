## Daily Journal
Read Frontend Frameworks with Vue3 > How to use Props in Vue and answer the following questions

1. What are props?
`
Props are like function/method properties/parameters/arguments, passing values and arguments into the function/vue component being called. Unlike function parameters, props are written into the HTML element creating the component as attributes.
`

2. What are props used for?
`
Props are used to pass values down from parent to child, one component to another. Props can be passed in as static values, or as JavaScript variables by using 'v-bind' or ':'
`

3. Where can props be used or accessed?
`
Props are created and managed by the parent component, which passes them down to the child component. The child component cannot pass the prop up to the parent, and the child cannot modify the parent's prop.
