Read Working In a Professional Environment > An Honest Guide to Building a Powerful Developer Portfolio and answer the following questions

1. What function does a developer Portfolio provide?
`
A developer portfolio provides a good place to showcase your skills, past projects, and work ethic. It gives you a central organized place to keep several of these things, and is in and of itself a portfolio project/app.
`

2. What makes a Developer Portfolio effective?
`
A developer portfolio should look good and be organized, and it should showcase your unique skills and knowledge. Another key part of what makes it effective is that it lets you show your critical thinking, decision making, proactiveness, and general desire/interest in the field.
`

3. What projects do you have that you would include in your Portfolio? Why?
`
I will definitely include my capstone project, because it shows off several skills (hard and soft skills), and it's unique to just my team. I would also include my bug log, because every coding company knows how they work, and they can understand whether mine works well. Finally, I might include some of my other CodeWorks projects, especially once I've gone back and refactored them.
