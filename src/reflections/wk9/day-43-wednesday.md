Read Working In a Professional Environment > Scrum for Small teams

1. How are some ways Scrum for a small team would differ from Scrum with a large team?
`
Smaller teams might need more open communication between the client and the developers, in order to reduce the number/length of required meetings, which can take away from needed development time. There may also be only one dev team, and there should only be one sprint per team, meaning that sprints might need to be shorter in order to also cover multiple development branches such as production and experimental.
`

2. Why does Scrum prescribe to only run 1 sprint at a time.
`
Scrum prescribes only one sprint at a time, because more than one can confuse team members, or one sprint might have prerequisites that the previous sprint creates. A particular product, app, or project might require there to be two workflows, a production build and an experimental build. Scrum proposes that each branch have it's own team with their own sprint, in order to keep it organized and keep both branches moving forward.
`

3. What is the unattainable triangle and what purpose does it have in Scrum?
`
The unattainable triangle is a set of three possible outcomes of work:
*Good* service *Cheap* won't be *Fast*
*Good* service *Fast* won't be *Cheap*
*Fast* service *Cheap* won't be *Good*
This is because each trait takes away from the other two, making only two of the three realistically attainable.
