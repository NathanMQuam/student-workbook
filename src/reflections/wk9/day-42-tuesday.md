## Daily Journal

Read Working In a Professional Environment > Github Actions and How to Use Them and answer the following questions

1. What is a Github action and how do they work?
`
GitHub actions are automated tasks that are run whenever certain events occur on the repository. These actions are run on specific events, such as a branch push, and in the case of the example in the student workbook, when a change is pushed it automatically builds.
`

2. What benefits do Github actions provide?
`
They can automate tasks that are always the same, like running a set of tests on newly pushed code and building if it passes. GitHub actions can also run on any machine or language, and the community has many templates already created.
`

3. What types of trigger actions can a workflow use? What do they do?
`
Workflow, Scheduled, WebHooks, and External.
