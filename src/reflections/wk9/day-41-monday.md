## Daily Journal

Reflect on your capstone project so far and answer the following questions

1. What technologies and principles are you using in your project?
`
So far, we're using Vue3, NPM modules like Axios, Auth0, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js. We've also used SCRUM for project management, MVC for a design pattern, Git and GitHub for version control.
`

1. What went well so far?
`
So far, we've planned out most of the project pretty well, and that's helped prevent confusion. With Ethan remote for part of the project, SCRUM has helped us keep in touch with him pretty well.
`

3. What would you do differently? Why?
`
I would assign a Product Owner and a Scrum Master for our team, so we have one person making business decisions. I would also have our team do more code documentation, there were a few times that would have helped.
