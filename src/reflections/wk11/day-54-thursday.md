## Final Reflection

Overall, I've had a really good time here at Boise CodeWorks. The course has continued to challenge and push me, despite me already having some experience with coding. Aside from the constant learning, the most enjoyable part of the course has been the culture here.

My biggest concerns for the upcoming final project are potentially time management. I feel pretty confident that I'll be able to independently complete the final, but the part that I'm the most worried about is possibly getting stuck on one part for too long and wasting time. To combat this, I have set up a trello board to follow a scrum-like workflow, and a general plan to hopefully guide my use of time.
