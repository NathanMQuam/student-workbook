Read Foundations of C# > C# List and answer the following questions

1. What is a List in C#?
`
A list is like an array from JavaScript, with the ability to add and remove items, and iterate over the list. There is an Array type in C#, but it has a fixed length and must always have exactly that many items.
`

2. What List methods seem like you might use them often? Why?
`
List constructor, \[index\], .add, .contains, .exists, .findAll, .findIndex, .insert, and .remove.
`
`These are methods similar to ones in JavaScript for arrays, and are used frequently.`

3. How would you retrieve an item from a list? What method could you use?
`
It depends on what information I already know, and what I need the item for. If I have the item's ID and need the whole object, I might use .find. Or if I only need to check if the item is in the list, I might use .contains or .exists.
