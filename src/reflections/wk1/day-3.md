## Daily Journal

Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Cheating At Design and answer the following questions

1. What is your favorite tip that you think is the most beneficial to improving your design?

2. Compile a couple resources that you think might be helpful when trying to review examples of good design ideas.

3. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?

### My Response

1. Using font color/contrast to control hierarchy instead of font-size. I frequently run into the issue of an unimportant line of text ending up too small to read. 

2. Here are a few good resources for examples of good design ideas:
    * [Dribbble's Color Search](https://dribbble.com/search/color)
    * [WordPress Themes](https://wordpress.com/themes)
    * [Coolors.co for generating/creating a color palette](https://coolors.co/generate)

3. Good design weighs heavily on a person's first impressions of a website, which will continue to affect the way they interact with the website. Good design alone can convey several things such as the tone or mood of a website, or the user experience, and even organization and hierarchy.
