### Weekly Reflections (Optional)

This reflection is an open format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week, or some of the things that you are still struggling with, identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally how you are feeling at this point in the course.

### My Response

I have learned how to use Bootstrap, I'm far from an expert, but using bootstrap speeds up the process even at my current level. I'm sometimes struggling with knowing what the name of the class is for a particular style I'm looking for, but that's what the docs are for. At this point, I don't think I've really struggled too much yet, but I'm looking forward to the coming weeks.
