Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > Wire-framing: A Comprehensive Guide and answer the following questions

1. What is the purpose of wire-framing?

2. What are the different levels of detail in wire-frames and why is each one useful?

3. Do you think wire-frames are worth the Time, Energy, and Effort that they require? Why or Why not?

### My Response

1. Wire-framing is a method/tool used by UX designers to lay down a basic layout and all of the required/desired functionality of an interface, usually but not always a website. There are typically three levels of wireframing, each with more fidelity and detail than the last.

2. The initial low-fidelity wireframe can be drawn with pen and paper, because it contains the minimum structure necessary to plan out the desired functionality. The mid-tier wireframe is usually used to give better layout to the mock design, and to start to add some visual design to the structure. Finally, the high-fidelity wireframe is designing the specifics of the interface, tailoring the details of what the final design will be.

3. I think wire-frames are usually worth the Time, Energy, and Effort, but it depends on the project and the different levels of detail. The first, low-fidelity wireframe takes little TEE, but has a good payoff for the TEE, laying down all the required elements of the interface. The mid-tier wireframe is usually worth the TEE, especially if you are working with others on a project. The highest fidelity wireframe takes quite a bit more TEE, making it's net worth depend heavily on the project, such as when the client has specific desires or requests for the design.
