Read Building Blocks Of Web Development > GIT 101 and answer the following questions
1. In your own words, why do we use Git?

2. What are the benefits of having multiple branches?

3. What is the difference between Git and GitHub

### My Response

1. We use git for version control, as we make changes to the code we can commit those changes, and are able to go back to a previous version if we need to. We can also make forks or branches of the repository, allowing us to commit changes without changing the main branch. Git also allows multiple people to work on the same project, and even the same file, at the same time without undoing each other's work.

2. Multiple branches are what allows the above people to work separately on one file. Each person can fork a new branch and make their changes, when they're done their branch is then merged back into a main branch. If multiple branches make changes to the same part of a file, git allows you to pick which parts of the changes to keep or discard.

3.  Git is a solution for source control, keeping track of all past and present versions of files, forking into multiple different branches and merging parts of changes back. GitHub is a website/service which hosts git repositories in the cloud, and can even host repositories of websites for public use.
