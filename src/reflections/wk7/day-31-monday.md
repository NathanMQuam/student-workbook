Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Pair Programming and answer the following questions

1. What is Pair Programming? What are the roles and how do they work?
`
Pair programming is a coding practice where two programmers are working at one computer. The person with the keyboard and mouse is called the driver, and the other is the navigator. They should both be communicating everything they're doing.
`

2. What are some benefits of Pair Programming?
`
Pair programming forces the driver to audibly say everything they're doing, making them think through everything, preventing some errors and going down blind alleys. Pair programming also diffuses knowledge and experience between the two, as well as cutting the coordination requirements of responsibilities in half.
`

3. What are some drawbacks to Pair Programming?
`
"A commonly cited best-case estimate of 15% overhead is claimed for systematic pairing, relative to individual work." And "it is claimed (again with some empirical support, though not entirely conclusive), is compensated by gains in code quality which usually entails significant maintenance penalties down the road."
