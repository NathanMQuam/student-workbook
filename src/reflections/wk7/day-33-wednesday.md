Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Designing a Strong User Experience and answer the following questions

1. What is a User Experience? What should be considered when developing a User Experience?
```"UX, or user experience, is every interaction your business has with people on your website, mobile site, apps, and online properties or services."```
`
When developing UX, the user and their feelings should be considered. What does the user *want* to do? Can they do that easily? Are they being forced in a direction they don't want to go?
`

2. What are some benefits of taking into account the User Experience?
`
For one thing, if the user is a customer, you want their business, and if they aren't happy or satisfied with the experience that becomes less likely. Taking the UX into account can also dictate how things should be structured or built, which can make planning the project easier.
`

3. Why is the User Experience important?
`
UX is a major factor in useability, you can't purchase something from a web store if you can't even get to the product's page. Also, you may have users with disabilities, and making the UX accessible to these users is also quite important.
