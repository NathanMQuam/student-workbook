## Daily Journal

Read Advancing with Vue 3 > Code documentation for JavaScript with JSDoc: an introduction and answer the following questions

1. What is Code Documentation? What are some of the ways to document code?
`
Code documentation writes out what code is supposed to do, what parameters it should take, and what it should return. There's howtos, readmes, and docs in the source. 
`

2. What are some benefits of Code Documentation?
`
Code documentation helps any developer get an understanding of what code does what and how to use it. This is effectively required for getting a new developer caught up, or even for the original author of the code when they come back to it after some time. Writing the JSDocs before writing the code can help you better name things, and write cleaner code.
`

3. How important is Code documentation and why?
`
It is important to have when other devs will be picking up code written by someone else, or even their own after some time away from it. It isn't always obvious what some code does, or what it needs as an input, which is where code documentation can clear things up, or at the very least point you in the right direction.
