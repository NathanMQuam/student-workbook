## Daily Journal

Reflect on your partner project and answer the following questions

1. Which principles from this weeks reading did you implement?
`
We used partner programming, with the driver and navigator. We also tried to consider the UX and made it so that a user saw all of their boards when they first went to the home page.

2. What went well?

3. What would you do differently?
`
Having the home page load all of a user's boards gave us a few unique issues, and while we resolved them it did take up more time. We also did not do any code documentation, which would have been helpful a few times.
