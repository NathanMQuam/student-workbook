# Understanding Asynchronous Code, and API's

**1.** What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
Synchronous code runs line-by-line in order, never breaking this pattern. Asynchronous code does not run line-by-line, and instead can have multiple operations, functions, and processes occuring at once, or set aside to occur later.
`
**2.** What is an event listener?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
An event listener is something that alerts other code to when a specific event occurs. For example, the 'ProxyState.on()' method in the BCW template.
`
**3.** What does the `O` represent in the `SOLID` principles?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
Open-Closed Principle
`
**4.** What is a callback / higher order function?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
Any function which takes in another function as at least one of it's parameters.
`
**5.** What is a `promise`? How do you capture an error from a `promise`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
A promise is an object representing the value of the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous opertation
`
**6.** Name three processes used to make requests over `HTTP`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE
`
**7.** What does the `API` acronym stand for?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
an Application Programming Interface
`
**8.** In the `MVC` design pattern, who is responsible for making calls to `APIs`?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
The services
`
**9.** What is the purpose of encapsulation in programming?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
Encapsulation bundles data and methods that handle that data within an object, allowing only that object to manipulate that data, and letting that object dictate what can access the data through it's methods.
`
**10.** What is `HTTP` response code for a successful request?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
100-200
`
**11.** What is a 500 error?
<!-- enter you answer in the space below -->
`
A server error, meaning it failed to fulfil an apparently valid request
